Dear Amaze Technologies,
I am trying to download your plug in onto my Surf Net internet brower and I am using a Surfbook Cloud 2016. Once I download it, it says it cannot be added to my browser. When I go into my Surf Net settings, the plug in shows up but is faded and I cannot add it to the browser. Is there another way to download this application? It appears that the link provided does not download properly to my system. If there is not another way to download this plug in, what do you recommend I do to get the plug in up and running? Thanks for your help, I hope we can find a solution.
Best Regards,
Tony Simmons
