Dear Jane,
Hi! I just purchased your Synthe software. For some reason I cannot add contacts to a category list. I noticed that there are "Active" and "Static" lists but not sure which ones I should be using. What is the difference between these two lists and how should I be using them effectively? My goal is to be able to modify lists every week after each email. I was hoping you could provide me with information on how to use each list and what the lists are best used for. Thank you for your help in advanced and information!
Best Regards,
Madelyn Cross
