Dear Amanda,
I am looking into purchasing the new model HB12S pizza oven from your Pizza Technologies website but not sure which will be best for what I will use it for. I am looking to be able to place it on top of my grill and gas stove. I want it to be able to fit a 16-inch pizza but most likely nothing bigger.
If you could provide a list of 3-4 options that would be amazing. Possibly a few points on each and what they are best used for? I want it to last me a long time, therefore, a variety of prices is welcomed.
Thank you so much for your help and I look forward to hearing about your portable pizza ovens!
Sincerely,
Haley Herman
