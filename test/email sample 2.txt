Dear Customer Support,
Hi! I just purchased your Synthe application from the official DigitALL Inc. website. For some reason I cannot add contacts to a category list anymore like I could with your older software. I have had this application for a month now but have not had to add to a list yet. I was able to create and export a list with no problem but It won't let me add a customer to this list once it is created. Do I have to create a new list every time? Is there no way to modify the list and add people of my choosing? Is there an option I should be clicking on to be able to do this? Please let me know what my options are when it comes to creating / modifying lists. Thanks for your help!
All the best,
Sarah Stec
