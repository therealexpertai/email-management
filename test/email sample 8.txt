Dear Mr. Ryans
I went to your Balmville, NY warehouse location last Monday to look at your granite countertop options. When I walked in nobody asked if I needed help or mentioned how the process would work. I walked around aimlessly looking at examples of granite but since it is the warehouse all there is for information is the number for the catalog. Since the catalog was not out, I had no idea what I was looking at. After about 30 mins of walking around the store and nobody helping me. I searched for an employee, I finally found someone sitting in the back area. When I asked for their help, they said that I could look for myself. Once I explained that I had been doing that for 30 mins and I was hoping for someone to show me around, they said that there was nobody there to walk me around and explain everything. I asked to see the catalog to help identify what I was looking at and the employee said that they could not share that with customers and only the employees could help me.
Finally, after no help or guidance I left the warehouse. I was very disappointed in my first experience there. It came highly recommended from a few friends and their experiences were much different than mine. I was looking for someone to show me around and give some advice on what I should be looking at for my new kitchen island.
I hope that we can find a solution to this problem because I would like to have an experience like my friends did. I look forward to hearing your suggested solution. It is very unfortunate that I even have to write this email.
Best regards,
Anne Williams
