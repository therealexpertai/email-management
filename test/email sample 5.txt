Hi Christina,
We spoke briefly on the phone about my kitchen remodeling. Now that we are ready to make a cabinet decision, I was hoping you could provide us with some information about which cabinets would be best for us.
We are looking to build an island but want all the cabinets to match - Parisienne models are interesting but have no matching cabs. They will have to be a few different sizes to accommodate all the odd corners in our kitchen. Would you be able to provide us with some cabinet options that come in different sizes? Also, a variety of woods/ textures would be amazing. We are not sold on any color just yet but was hoping you could help with that too!
Thank you for your guidance and we look forward to remodeling our kitchen island with French Kitchens & Co.
All the best,
Julia O'Connor
