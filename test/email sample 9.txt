Dear Emma,
I am writing this email to you because my chicken sandwich was made incorrectly based on my online order with complete disregard for my allergy. This incident happened on January 9th, 2019 at your Austin, TX location.
I have ordered this sandwich many times and have had small problems in the past but, not like this. I ordered a chicken sandwich with NO mushrooms. On the notes I mentioned that I am extremely allergic to mushrooms and to please ensure that no mushrooms were on the sandwich. I unclicked the mushroom option on the app along with other toppings that I did not want to be included. I picked up my sandwich and it had all the toppings on it including the other toppings that I had unclicked. Despite the extra notes in the comment section, the mushrooms were on it too. I could not eat my sandwich even if I wanted to. I think it is terrible that allergies were completely disregarded in this order.
When I called the store to complain they said they would not send me a new one or give me my money back because I ordered through the app. Why is it that since I used the app that you promote, I cannot be given a refund for an order that I am allergic to.
I have enjoyed your sandwiches for any years but after this I am not sure that I will be supporting this location or business again. I look forward to hearing from you and your proposed solution to this very unfortunate order. Thank you for your future efforts to make this right.
Sincerely,
Karen Thompson
